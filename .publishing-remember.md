# Publishing Reminder

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Always Publish to BOTH Marketplaces

When publishing a new version of TestFox, **ALWAYS** use:

```bash
npm run publish:all
```

This command automatically publishes to:
1. ✅ VS Code Marketplace
2. ✅ OpenVSX Registry

## Stored Credentials

- **VS Code Marketplace PAT**: Stored in `VSCE_PAT` user environment variable
- **OpenVSX Access Token**: Stored in `OVSX_PAT` user environment variable
  - Token: `ovsxat_d16bbdb8-247e-42fc-b609-671ecc522b5d`

## Quick Reference

```bash
# Publish to BOTH marketplaces (USE THIS)
npm run publish:all

# VS Code Marketplace only
npm run publish

# OpenVSX only
npm run publish:openvsx
```

## Before Publishing

1. Update version in `package.json`
2. Update `CHANGELOG.md`
3. Run `npm run compile`
4. Run `npm run publish:all` ← **ALWAYS USE THIS**
